# AnotherJsonLib.Utility.Operations

## Overview
The `AnotherJsonLib.Utility.Operations` namespace provides a suite of utility classes designed to simplify working with JSON documents. These utilities enable operations such as merging, mapping, querying, and patching JSON data, making it easier to handle complex JSON manipulation tasks.

## Classes
Below is an overview of the classes available in the `AnotherJsonLib.Utility.Operations` namespace. Each class includes a link to its detailed documentation:

- [JsonMerger](operations/JsonMerger.md): Combines multiple JSON documents into a single result, with configurable conflict resolution strategies.
- [JsonMapping](operations/JsonMapping.md): Transforms JSON documents by mapping properties between different structures.
- [JsonPatchGenerator](operations/JsonPatchGenerator.md): Generates JSON Patch operations to describe and apply changes between two JSON documents.
- [JsonPathQuery](operations/JsonPathQuery.md): Extracts data from JSON structures using JSONPath syntax, optimized for performance.
- [JsonPointer](operations/JsonPointer.md): References specific values in JSON documents using [RFC 6901 JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) syntax.
- [JsonSorter](operations/JsonSorter.md): Normalizes JSON by consistently ordering object properties for standardized representations.
- [JsonStreamer](operations/JsonStreamer.md): Processes JSON data in a streaming manner, ideal for large files or memory-constrained environments.

## Common Edge Cases
When using these utilities, consider the following edge cases:

1. **Large Documents**: Operations on very large JSON documents may impact performance.
2. **Circular References**: JSON documents with circular references are unsupported and may cause errors.
3. **Special Characters**: Properly escape special characters in JSON paths to avoid parsing issues.
4. **Schema Changes**: Ensure the JSON structure matches the expected schema to prevent failures.
5. **Numeric Precision**: Be cautious of precision loss when handling floating-point numbers.

## Best Practices
To maximize the effectiveness of these utilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Validate Input**: Always validate JSON input to ensure it is well-formed and adheres to the expected schema.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as malformed JSON or unexpected data structures.
3. **Optimize for Performance**: Use streaming approaches (e.g., `JsonStreamer`) for large JSON documents to reduce memory usage.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test operations with a variety of edge cases, including empty objects, arrays, and null values.
5. **Document Usage**: Clearly document the intended use cases and limitations of each utility in your project.

## General Guidelines
- **Understand the Use Case**: Choose the appropriate utility based on the specific JSON operation you need to perform.
- **Leverage Documentation**: Refer to the detailed documentation for each class to understand its capabilities and limitations.
- **Monitor Performance**: Profile your application to identify potential bottlenecks when working with large or complex JSON data.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep the library updated to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

By adhering to these guidelines and best practices, you can effectively utilize the `AnotherJsonLib.Utility.Operations` namespace to handle JSON data with confidence and efficiency.
